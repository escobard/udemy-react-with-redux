// creates our reducer component

// all reducers get 2 arguments, the current state, and action
// in other words, reducers are only ever called when an action happens, which in turn changes the state
// of the reducer
// 
// IMPORTANT: state argument is not application state, only the state this reducer is responsible for
// IF the reducer is responsible for the state of a component, then it changes the state of that component, in this case BookList's state

			// this case will return the action's payload, in this case this is our book
			// try to return a fresh object, leave state manipulation out of the action.type switch statements
			return action.payload;

	// if a state is 'undefined', which is what will happen if we do not have a default state for this action,
